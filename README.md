# Description
This is my build of spotify using Next.js, react, Spotify API, Tailwindcss, Recoil, NextAuth and Middleware. I have built a complete new frontend for spotify, In the app you can play your playlists, pause songs, change volume and much more, you need the follow the following steps to run the app. The app will run on localhost:3000.

# Steps:

(1) Download all the dependencies in package.json

(2) npx install @heroicons/react

(3) npm -i next-auth@beta

(4) npm install spotify-web-api-node

(5) npm install tailwind-scrollbar-hide

(6) npm i lodash

(7) npm install recoil

(8) npm run dev -> run the application

(9) Open localhost:3000 you will see a log in page.

(10) You need spotify premium to run this application, open spotify premium in another app to make use of this app.

(11) In the .env.local file change the NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_SECRET and NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID you get from the spotify developer dashboard.

(12) After that you will be able to use your spotify with the UI and UX I have designed with the ability to play all the songs on your playlist.
